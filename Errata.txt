FIXED1) Silkscreen font too small - does not print well
FIXED2) X3 programming header has completely wrong spacing
IGNORED3) MINOR - soldermask on micro does not go all the way to copper pads
FIXED4) Battery input not connected to VBAT in schematic or on board.
FIXED5) Q1 micro resonator has slightly wrong spacing for the part used.
FIXED6) Pin numbering on LED silk screen is wrong
FIXED7) LED soldermask could be a bit wider
FIXED8) Q3 crystal is incorrect footprint.  Replaced with Newark 76R7536
FIXED9) SCK needs to be wired between the two boards.  SCK, MOSI, and GND.  NOT 5V.
FIXED10) Accelerometer should have an anti-aliasing filter.  ADXL337 uses external caps on outputs.
FIXED11) Replace accelerometer with cheaper version
FIXED12) LDC1000 coil should have a 100pF cap in parallel.
FIXED13) Need to redo tactile switch footprint to match Newark part number 14P9504
FIXED14) Need to redo resonator footprint to match Newark part number 11N7357
FIXED15) Need to replace ADXL193 with ADXL337 Newark part number 94T2513
FIXED16) Edit battery footprint to eliminate extra pins
??????17) Add double battery footprint to increase battery capacity.
FIXED18) Boost IC and associated components should move down away from battery
PARTIAL19) Should eliminate all SparkFun footprints.  Fixing ground symbol causes problems.  Many of the parts are SparkFun.  Fixed many.  Remaining: R10 (adafruit), S2, GND, 5V, JP1, Q1
FIXED20) Need to power ADXL337 with between 1.8 and 3.6V.  Use regulator like 13M2085.  Should wire supply voltage to an ADC.
FIXED21) Check centroids of all parts on the board.
FIXED22) Fix battery footprint to eliminate extra pads - they are interfering with routing.
FIXED23) Outside LEDs will currently be ~ 17.6 mm apart if the boards are edge to edge.  However, if the board edges overlap and the X1 and X2 connector holes line up exactly, the outside LEDs will be ~9.5 mm apart.  That will have to be good enough, or the connectors will interfere with the LEDs.  The LEDs could probably shrink a bit more if we wanted to get really picky, but 9.5 is pretty close to 9.

New features
FIXED1) Add SiLabs CP2104 to get full reprogramming capability for only $1.43 per board.  Consider Microchip MCP2200 because it is cheaper on Newark ($1.94 with no contract discount).  There's also a footprint on Newark.  However, it requires an oscillator, which will add more money.  Probably best to get the CP2104 from Digikey.  Ensure TXO and RXI are connected correctly - verify with Banggood board.
FIXED2) Pattern USB connector fingers onto the board to make a cheap USB connector.  Pad out thickness with tape or something for a decent fit in the USB slot.  For prototype, used Newark 01J8375, Molex 48037-1000.  Review Power_Jackslt from the SparkFun library on how to handle slots.  Mill layer needs to be sent to the board house.
FIXED3) Add Zeners to the Vcc, D+ and D- lines of the USB connector.
